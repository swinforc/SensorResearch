# SensorResearch
Repository for software related to sensor research. Any software pertaining to the sensors aboard our platform will be placed here.
This repository will allow for easy tracking of the changes made to the software developed. Below are a few basic github terms that will assist in removing any confusion when it comes to using github.

A commit is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit.

Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project.

Once you're done with the page, you can merge your changes from your branch into the master branch.
